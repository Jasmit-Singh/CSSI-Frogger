Welcome to my Frogger Game
======================

This is the Frogger game that I created during Google's Computer Science Summer Institute. Using variables, functions, and collision detection, an interactive game was created. 

Directions:
=========
Use the arrow keys to move the frog. Hitting the car will result in the loss of one life. Reaching the finish line will add your score by 100 points and reset the frog's location back to the finish line. Keep hopping around until you lose all your lives. Compete with friends and have fun!
